# Shepherds-Form_Management
Program to sift through form data and output users who have not responded

Simple to use: 
  1. Go to the Google docs of the forms you are interested in. (ie. Mentee Feedback File, Mentor Feedback File, intake forms from two weeks prior)
  2. Download the forms as csv.
  3. Open program in your preferred IDE or Notebook that supports Python. (You may have to install Pandas)
  4. Run program and select the files you are interested in.
  5. The program will return the email address of each participant who has yet to respond to the feedback form. You can use this to look them up on Slack 
  and send them a nudge.
